# Project Source Codes:
1. [Draw Line](https://github.com/coh1616/Portfolio-Python-Project-Advance/blob/main/Python_Projects/draw_line.py)
   - The program displays the points at odd number of clicks and becomes a line at even number of clicks.
2. [Bouncing Ball](https://github.com/coh1616/Portfolio-Python-Project-Advance/blob/main/Python_Projects/bouncing_ball.py)
   - The program displays the animation of bouncing ball with gravity. And the bouncing height after every collision will reduce. The animation will not be triggered anymore after 3 complete bouncing turns.
3. [Breakout Game](https://github.com/coh1616/Portfolio-Python-Project-Advance/blob/main/Python_Projects/breakout.py)
   - Animation & Game Designing
4. [Pedestrian Removing Application](https://github.com/coh1616/Portfolio-Python-Project-Advance/blob/main/Python_Projects/stanCodoshop.py)
   - Image Processing
5. [Name Popularity Searching System](https://github.com/coh1616/Portfolio-Python-Project-Advance/blob/main/Python_Projects/babygraphics.py)
   - Data Structure
6. [Boggle Game Solver](https://github.com/coh1616/Portfolio-Python-Project-Advance/blob/main/Python_Projects/boggle.py) & [Anagram](https://github.com/coh1616/Portfolio-Python-Project-Advance/blob/main/Python_Projects/anagram.py)
